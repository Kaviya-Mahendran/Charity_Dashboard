# Charity Shop Performance Dashboard

### Project Summary
This project is a performance dashboard designed for a charity shop, created using data from a mock retail database. The goal is to provide key insights into operational performance, sales trends, and donor behavior to help management make data-driven decisions.

### Problem Statement
The charity shop, with multiple locations and various donation channels, lacks a centralized way to monitor its performance. Key business questions, such as "What are our best-performing locations?" and "What product categories are most profitable?" are difficult to answer without a clear, visual dashboard. This project addresses these needs.

### Methodology
The dashboard was built using **[Tool Used, e.g., Power BI or Tableau Public]**. The process included:
1.  **Data Connection**: The `charity_shop_performance.csv` file was loaded.
2.  **Data Modeling**: The data was reviewed for accuracy and prepared for analysis.
3.  **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Several KPIs were created to track financial and operational performance, including Total Sales, Sales by Location, and Revenue by Payment Method.
4.  **Interactive Dashboard Design**: Visualizations were arranged on a single dashboard with interactive filters for easy exploration.
